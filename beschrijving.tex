	\section*{Problem Description}
	
	We aim to optimize the allocation of resources across multiple projects. Specifically, we assign individuals to projects while determining their level of involvement, maximizing the total subsidy earnings.

	
	\subsection*{Decision Variables}
	Let \( x_i^j \in [0,1] \) be a continuous decision variable, where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( i \) represents a project.
		\item \( j \) represents a person.
		\item \( x_i^j \) denotes the hours person \( j \) dedicates to project \( i \).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Objective Function}
	The objective is to maximize the total subsidy earnings, defined as:
	\[
	\max \sum_{i} \sum_{j} \alpha_j  \cdot P_j\cdot x_i^j
	\]
	where:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \( P_j \) is the cost per person $j$ expressed as rate per hour.
		\item \( \alpha_j \) is a weighting factor accounting for the subsidy percentage.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{Constraints}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Project Resource Requirement:  }
		Each project requires a fixed level of involvement:
		\[
		\sum_j x_i^j  = \delta_i, \quad \forall i
		\]
		where \( \delta_i \) is the required man months for project \( i \).
	
	    \item \textbf{Individual Workload Limit:  }
		Each person can only work up to a full-time equivalent (FTE) of 1720 per year:
		\[
		\sum_i x_i^j \leq 1720, \quad \forall j
		\]
		
		\item \textbf{Project-Specific Constraints:  }
		Certain projects may have individual-specific constraints restricting some people or forcing people from participating:
		\[
		x_i^j = 0, \quad \forall i, j
		\]
		\[
		x_i^j >= \phi_i^j, \quad \forall i, j
		\]
		
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution Approach}
This problem is formulated as a linear programming (LP) optimization problem and can be (hopefully) efficiently solved using the Branch and Bound method.
